Git init,
git status,
git commit -m 'Message',
git add,
git pull,
git push,
etc.


I will use all of these frequently to set up a project, then once I want to add my changes to github, I can do that as well. I can also pull from github if I am collaborating with someone else. git diff will check to see what is different.
